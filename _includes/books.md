<h2> Current Book</h2>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delicate-Art-Bureaucracy-Transformation-Wrestler-ebook/dp/B086XM4WCK">The Delicate Art of Bureaucracy</a> by Mark Schwarz
<p> I've been reading this book for an embarassingly long time but I always enjoy it when I pick it up. I love Mark Schwarz's writing style and liberal arts references. For a quick overview, he has given several talks on the concepts he writes about including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwHVlJtqhaI"> this one</a> which I watched relatively recently. I've also read other books he has written and have hosted a TechTalk by him as part of a tech talk program, so I'm definitely a fan.
