<h2> Current Book</h2>
<a> <https://a.co/d/3uYyw6b> Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter</a> by Liz Wiseman

<h2> Completed Book Reviews and Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The Delicate Art of Bureaucracy by Mark Schwartz</li>
  <p> I reread this several times because it took an embarrassingly long time for me to finish it. I always enjoyed it when I picked it up, so it worked out in my favor. I love Mark Schwarz's writing style and liberal arts references. For a quick overview, he has given several talks on the concepts he writes about including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwHVlJtqhaI"> this one</a>. I've also read other books he has written and have hosted a TechTalk by him as part of a tech talk program, so I'm definitely a fan. The book details the challenges associated with being suddenly thrust into a government IT leadership position from the private sector and Mark's approach to change the culture as the CIO of the DHS USCIS. My experience working with the government as well as my experience complying with government regulations in software development may have made it an even more enjoyable read, but it resonated with my experiences in both the private and public sectors. In short, inject chaos and observe, seek simplicity, and use the system and its rules to your advantage.</p>
